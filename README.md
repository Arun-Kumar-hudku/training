1. Sorter
Implement a class called Sorter which has the following four public methods
public void doBubbleSort(int a[]);
public void doSelectionSort(int a[])’
public void doInsertionSort(int a[]);
public void doQuickSort(int a[]);


2. Eight Queens
The eight queens problem is the problem of placing eight queens on a 8×8 chessboard
such that none of them attack one another (no two are in the same row, column, or diagonal).

When the solve() method is called it should print all possible unique solutions,
printing each solution in a line and finally should print the Total number of solutions.

As an example one possible solution could be
15863724

There are eight numbers printed, each digit giving the column number and the position of
the digit is the row number.

So in the above example, in 1st row, 1st column a queen is placed, then in 2nd row, 5th column,
then in 3rd row 8th column and so on.

An elegant solution makes use of a single dimensional array and solves using Recursion and BackTracking.


Implement the class EightQueens
public void solve();
